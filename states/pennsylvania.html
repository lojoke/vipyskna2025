                Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern United States, bordered by New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, and Lake Erie. It is the 33rd largest state by area and the 5th most populous state. It has 67 counties and its capital is Harrisburg. Its largest city is Philadelphia, which was also the first capital of the United States. It is known as the “Keystone State” because of its central role in the formation of the country, as well as the “Quaker State” because of its founder, William Penn, who was a Quaker.

            <p>
                Pennsylvania has a long and rich history, dating back to the Native American tribes that inhabited the region, such as the Lenape, the Susquehannock, the Iroquois, and others. It was explored and colonized by the Dutch, the Swedish, and the English, who established trading posts and settlements along the Delaware River and Bay. It was part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, the Swedish colony of New Sweden, and the English colony of Pennsylvania, until it declared its independence in 1776. It was the site of many important events and battles during the American Revolution, such as the First and Second Continental Congresses, the Declaration of Independence, the Liberty Bell, the Battle of Brandywine, the Battle of Germantown, the Valley Forge, and the Battle of Monmouth. It was the second state to ratify the U.S. Constitution in 1787. It was also the site of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, where the Founding Fathers drafted and signed the Constitution. It was the first state to abolish slavery in 1780.
